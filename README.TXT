1) Create the basis of regions:
    a) Give it the proper values for each object to hold on to
    b) Organize them in a neat and recognizable way for later use
2) Initialize all regions
3) Initialize players and the required "stuff"(Because I'm still unsure of it)
4) Create a section to take turns claiming regions
    a) If possible, add bonuses for owning certain sections of land
        i) Owning entire continents, for sure
        ii) Owning a monopoly on theoretical resources, maybe
5) Create the main portion of the game
    a) Regions with more than 1 set of soldiers can attack
    b) Chances depend on attacking and defending forces, chance scales with both
        i) 1v1 = 1/2, 2v1 = 2/3, 1v2 = 1/3, etc.
    c) End battle section and start reinforcing section
    d) End turn and move to next player's turn
